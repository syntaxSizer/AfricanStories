      <p>That same night,<br/>
He picked me along the way.<br/>
He charmed me with his bundles.<br>
He assured me of pleasure each day.<br/>
He took me around his castles.<br/>
He asked me to stay.</p><br/>

<p>That same night,<br/>
I forgot about mypimples.<br/>
I only felt gay.<br/>
I could only feel my dimples.<br/>
I looked forward to his nightly play.</p><br/>
<p>That same night,<br/>
His body moved like ripples.<br/>
His hands felt softer than clay.<br/>
His smooch gave me tickles.<br/>
His form warmer than an overlay.</p><br/>
<p>That same night,
He began to sway.<br/>
He curved in like a sickle.<br/>
He shoved me away.<br/>
He chased me like trouble.<br/>
He denied me my pay,<br/>
He only gave me prickles.</p><br/>
<p>That same night<br/>
I couldn’t believe the betray,<br/>
I left in hustles.<br/>
I rushed for the subway.<br/>
I was all left a ramshackle,<br/>
I only had to pray.<br/>
I dreaded that one night.</p><br/>

<h1 align="center"><br/><br/>Pre-Naivasha Days</h1><br/>
<!-- author name-->
<p align="center" style="font-size:12px">Emmanuel Monychol</p><br/>

<p>We used to fight flies and heat<br/>
In the bullet ridden grass thatched huts,<br/>
We lived in the hope of milk and honey.<br/>
We tried to share the little we got<br/>
with guerrilla forces<br/>
Who lived in hope too and tried<br/>
To survive with little or no food and water<br/>
Tyre sandals for shoesand oldclothes looted or donated.<br/><br/><br/>
The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement united us.<br/>
Yes! We were united: together, Army and ordinary Citizens.<br/>
We decorated our bodies with ostrich feathers;<br/>
We danced and smiled, we laughed and celebrated<br/>
Together, we ate,together we drank,<br/>
Together we poured libations to bless the spirits<br/>
Of the fallen heroes buried or abandoned.<br/><br/><br/>
The Guerrilla Generals-turned-Politicians <br/>
Cruised the V-8 vehicles in our new dustbowl<br/>
They swim amidst ill-hooked wealth,<br/>
Cool Juba heat with the air conditioners<br/>
Chilling out of the newly furnished<br/>
Bungalows and palaces.<br/><br/><br/>
We fight flies and fan off the airless heat in congested<br/>
Tin roofed shelters without ceiling boards<br/>
And ventilated window-after Naivasha Days.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:12px">Emmanuel Monychol</p><br/>
<p>Walking by the riverside,<br/>
Imagining dark eyes,<br/>
Tiny fish in Blue Ocean,<br/>
Crocodiles struggling to feed,<br/>
Hippos in the deep,<br/><br/><br/>
Waiting for the night to come.<br/>
Young Calypso suddenly appeared<br/>
In her flying dress,<br/>
Balancing a water jar –and singing.<br/>
I tried to stop her just to say, “Hello.”<br/>
The water jar dropped, water flooded the green grass<br/>
Forcefully uprooting and clearing weeds back to river.<br/><br/><br/>
Calypso’s voice rang: “Daddy! Daddy!<br/>
He has raped me.”<br/><br/><br/>
I saw gigantic hands<br/>
Hold me by the throat.<br/>
A man in uniform
Manacled my hands.<br/><br/><br/>
Three years later<br/>
The man with gigantic
hands died; he left a letter,<br/>
Urging me to promise him
A grandchild</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:12px">Sophie N.Namwoyeraki</p><br/>
<p>Your teeth have fled their nest.<br/><br/>
Dust rules over the Holy Book.<br/><br/>
Untouched buttons of your radio look on.<br/><br/>
Curtain folds are like a nurse’s starched uniform.<br/><br/>
Your soup bowl has become a roach’s pool.<br/><br/>
Your appetite is painted in dull colours.<br/><br/>
Your walking stick is the centre in the spider’s handcraft.<br/><br/>
Vivacity basks in a second childhood.<br/><br/>
The sturdy voice that bounced on walls is now drained.<br/><br/>
The kite-sharp eyesight simmers on dying fire.<br/><br/>
Your countenance is the light of a fast sinking sun.<br/><br/>
Muscles of steel now soft like newly ground corn.<br/><br/>
Humour has abandoned your garden.<br/><br/>
Where are the mighty hands that lifted me when I fell?<br/><br/>
Silent weeds strangle years.<br/><br/>
Tendrils of life are tangled up and bewildered<br/><br/>
Your worm-eaten garb sways in the wind.<br/><br/>
My eyes well up and rage weighs my throat down.<br/><br/>
You are the mahogany never meant to shed his leaves</p>

But a voice resounded within<br/><br/>

<h1 align="center"><br/><br/>The Eye of Poetry</h1><br/>
<p align="center" style="font-size:12px">Lilian A.Aujo</p><br/>

<p>Poetry is the school I will never graduate from<br/>
because no matter how hard –I try<br/>
I will never tell it all –the secret way of its patterns<br/>
And how the same letters form different syllables to form different words,<br/>
And how they fall –in front or behind one another, and if re-arranged would create a whole<br/>
different story...<br/>
It is how emotions run<br/>
High –Low –Calm –Serene<br/>
Vivacious, like the sun at noon, surreal like the fantasy it promises<br/>
You never know when poetry goes subtleor quiet. How even when there,<br/>
It grows deep like a river that bleeds <br/>
when the dry earth has sucked out her waters...poetry...</p><br/>
<p>It is the bird song I cannot articulate<br/>
The trickle of the tap in a porcelain sink<br/>
The whoosh of the wind that makes my skin stand on end<br/>
That thing that knocks the breath out of my lungs<br/>
The music in you, unsung, yet so fervent you tingle within<br/>
The notes in the air unwritten on sheets. Tangible, intangible, whatever you please</p><br/>
<p>It is useless to try to fathom how,<br/>
Without seeming to say much, it says so much,<br/>
How it clings to you like the little hand of a small child begging you to stay<br/>
Or, like the sticky filmy strands of the spider whose web you never see –but,<br/>
You walk right into anyway...</p><br/>
<p>It is the sweet tangle between fantasy and realism<br/>
And metaphysics and apathy and breath and death<br/>
But do not worry if the opposites don’t quite match or get criss-crossed right:<br/>
The rhythms do not always match...<br/>
see,there indisorder exists the same beauty eminent in order,<br/>
I have cometo learn,<br/>
That free verse, sonnet, haiku, list, and lyrical when tweaked just right<br/>
Are like a violin in the hands of a skilled violinist: so many songs from the tip of one bow</p><br/>
<p>I live, breathe, dream poetry, in syllables so sweet they tantalise my mind<br/>
Tie and untie my tongue so I have no choice but try to tell of its complexity,<br/>
Of all the stories that are spun like the silky strands of <i>Ananse’s</i> tales<br/>
And the flighty cunning of a hare’s escapades...<br/>
I laugh so hard tears kiss the corners of my eyes,<br/>
I learn lessons that might have remained unlearnt had they been in plain black or white<br/>
See, the twists are new with every turn<br/>
Like a child’s wheel let loose and thrashing through bushes<br/>
Like heavy rain drops never knowing their mark–
Like the water ina lake that flows in itself and never knows where it ends andor where it begins...<br/>
yes it is that meld...</p><br/>
<p>...the sublime, the divine...that you never touch<br/>
Yet you know how it feels...<br/>
It is the beauty you want to explain but words are always inept to describe<br/>
It is poetry...existent in as many exquisite and intrinsic patterns<br/>
As there are on a peacock’s tail:</p><br/>
<p><i>While she sits, her iridescent plumage dazzles us,<br/>
And when she fans her tail, we see her eye...<br/>
Hypnotically beautiful...<br/>
spiralling into the magical chasm of poetry...<br/>
Do you see the eye of poetry?</i></p>

<h1 align="center"><br/><br/>It’s a Night Job</h1><br/>
<p align="center" style="font-size:12px">Joanita Male</p><br/>
<p>You have to understand, I did not to choose this life-it  chose  me.My childhood had somehow<br/>
prepared me for this job –if you can call it a job that is. My mother had the same job and her<br/>
mother as well. I guess I couldn’t escape it.<br/>
It’s a cold evening, and it's around 7 pm. I’m sure it will not rain today. The rain cuts business down<br/>
almost to zero. You see, the street side is not a place to be during a downpour. The sky is a<br/>
dark blue with a few stars spread out, that’s how I know it will not rain. I’ve been told stars are a<br/>
sure sign that the skies will hold back.<br/>
<i>Thank God!</i><br/>
I’m wearing the white dress, the stretchy one that shows the curve of my hips clearly. White is a<br/>
good colour when you’re trying to be noticed among several other girls, especially when your<br/>
complexion is as dark as mine.My make-up has been applied.My mum taught me how to wear <br/>
make-up. Maroon lipstick (red was for the light skinned ones) and a bit of eye shadow. I’m wearing<br/>
six  inch heels, not so much for fashion but more to be noticed easier. At 5’ 1”, I am one of the<br/>
shorter girls here. I’m not wearing any underwear; I have learnt that sometimes the only way to get<br/>
customers is to give a preview of what’s to come.<br/>
I’m standing on Burton Street, the small stretch before the roundabout to Yusuf Lule road. Most<br/>
of the  girls are already there.This street has no lights at all. I like that about it,any sign of lights<br/>
means we have a potential client. The buildings on this street are homes that were turned into <br/>
offices. They have domineeringgates with large signposts at the entrance. There isn’t a sound from<br/>
them at this time.<br/>
Lights.I quickly bend over, enough to give the driver a glimpse of what he will be getting if they<br/>
choose me. I manage to bend yet still twist my body so they can see a bit of my face. I’m smiling.<br/>
I’m good at that now. It comes with practice; I don’t have to be happy to smile. I can conjure up a<br/>
smile at your slightest bidding...it’s one of the requirements ofthe job.<br/>
A whitecorona slows down next to me, I can tell by the car that this clientmight not pay as<br/>
handsomely as I would like, but I learnt a long time ago not to pass up any offers, you might go<br/>
hungry if you do.<br/>
A dark face is staring at me all I see are wide eyes and sparkling teeth.<br/>
“Get in,” he shouts with impatience. He has to drive off before anyone sees him. I jump in, still<br/>
smiling, I’m not sure where we are going, but I have to be clear on my prices.<br/>
“Long or short?” I ask loudly, with my eyebrows raised, it’s something I always do.<br/>
“Long, how much?” he shouts out.<br/>
<i>This might be a difficult one</i>,I think to myself.“Fifty thousand,”I say.<br/>
“Okay,” he blurts out as we drive off to what I assume is Ntinda. Getting home won’t be too<br/>
expensive, I stay in Naalya and that’s pretty close to where we’re going. We pull up at Max’s<br/>
motel. Everyone that stays in Ntinda uses this spot. We come out of the car and he rushes out.I<br/>
follow after him like an unwanted puppy. They always act this way at first, like they’re doing you a<br/>
favour.<br/>
 I hate this part!We get to the room and he wastes no time taking off his clothes. He lays there on the double bed<br/>
covered with a thick brown blanket. Everything about this motel is dull.Ugly brown curtains to<br/>
match the blankets, cream walls and basic furniture, everything looks as if they were dragged <br/>
out of the nearby primary school.<br/><br/>
Everything about this motel is dull apart from the people. The different clients that is.They range<br/>
from the boda-boda rider who decides to pleasure himself with the day’s earnings to the city tycoon<br/>
who tries to remain inconspicuouson his visits.
I look down at him and he is well built,much better than most of my usual clients. He looks at me<br/>
waiting. I hate this part too. The beginning. I pull up my dress. Even though he’s paying for ‘long’ I<br/>
am determined to give him ‘short’. I’m not in the mood to do too much today. I’ll please him<br/>
enough to the point where he can’t tell the difference. We are at it now; this is the part that I don’t<br/>
hate so much, the satisfaction I give them. All of them. We rock away as the motel bed creaks.<br/>
I can partly hear the beds in the neighbouring rooms making the same sound; it’s like a song matching<br/>
rhythms, matching beats. His face is twisted almost as if he is in pain. I know that means I am doing<br/>
a good job.<br/>
He’s a first timer. I’m sure of it. He asked the price. No one ever asks the price.<br/>
It’s over now. I’m thinking about it and I am pretty sure this is the part I actually hate the most.<br/>
The  self-loathing. The moment I start to blame all of this on my mother, the point where I am<br/>
flooded with memories of listening to my mother cry every night when they left. The different men<br/>
she brought home,that is. I always wondered what made her so unhappy. She had enough money<br/>
to look after us on her own and she was a good mother. It’s only now that I am older that I<br/>
understand.<br/>
“Pay up,” I shout.<br/>
I am not smiling any more. When it’s time to get paid it helps not to smile.<br/>
“But, you’re expensive,”
<i>Of course now that it’s over, he realizes.</i>I don’t say anything, arguing never<br/>
works, I just look at him, stare actually. He pulls out a crumpled fifty thousand shilling note. The
old notes, the ones that are larger and much paler. I grab it and stick it in my bra before he changes
his mind. He go
es to the tiny bathroom to wash off.
He really is a first timer.
I waste no time rummaging through
his trousers. Nothing.
I check h
is shirt, there’s a wallet, a few
crumpled ten thousands
, I grab them
and
then
I’m gone.
Max’s motel is conveniently o
r should I say inconveniently situated away from the main road. This
means I have to call my
boda
-
boda
guy.
Great!
I’m home now. I throw
on  pair  of  leggings  befo
re  I  got  home;  I  wonder  what
girls  did  before
leggings  were  in  vogue.  Mother  opens  the  door.
She  is  smiling  at  me;  she  knows  I  have  some
money for her. She stopped bringing the men home a long time ago; there isn’t a large market for
hookers  over  fifty.
How  did  I  get  myself  into  this?
I
can’t even explain
to  myself.  Maybe  it  was
because of
the sev
eral daddies
I had or
watching my mother
apply make
-
up every day and somehow
look after us. Or maybe it’s the fact that I was raised on the words “Look a
fter  your  body,  you
never know when you’ll need it to make a living.” Maybe that’s it.
It’s the recep
tionist job I have, that
’s where I get the money. This is what I tell her
,
this is what
she pretends to believe.
Maybe she does believe it
, I don’t really know. Mother sticks out her small
hand, waiting. Even at fifty she’s still in great shape even though
she isn’t as beautiful as
she used to
be. The job took its
toll on her. There’s a shadow of regret behind every smile she
wears,
maybe
this is the effect of the night job.
That’s why
I’
m going
to stop, seriously. Soon, someday
. I greet
her and hand over the fifty thousand note, she’s still smiling as she goes on about how much I make
her proud. Okay, I’m certain now, this really is actually the part I hate the most, my mother’s
adoration.
I walk to my room, I have a long day
tomorrow, my u
niversity class has a sociology
test to site.
