      <p>That same night,<br/>
He picked me along the way.<br/>
He charmed me with his bundles.<br>
He assured me of pleasure each day.<br/>
He took me around his castles.<br/>
He asked me to stay.</p><br/>

<p>That same night,<br/>
I forgot about mypimples.<br/>
I only felt gay.<br/>
I could only feel my dimples.<br/>
I looked forward to his nightly play.</p><br/>
<p>That same night,<br/>
His body moved like ripples.<br/>
His hands felt softer than clay.<br/>
His smooch gave me tickles.<br/>
His form warmer than an overlay.</p><br/>
<p>That same night,
He began to sway.<br/>
He curved in like a sickle.<br/>
He shoved me away.<br/>
He chased me like trouble.<br/>
He denied me my pay,<br/>
He only gave me prickles.</p><br/>
<p>That same night<br/>
I couldnâ€™t believe the betray,<br/>
I left in hustles.<br/>
I rushed for the subway.<br/>
I was all left a ramshackle,<br/>
I only had to pray.<br/>
I dreaded that one night.</p><br/>
